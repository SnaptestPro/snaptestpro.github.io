## What was done
- `safe-html.js` (loaded first on every page): `__sx` text/attr escape, `__sj` inline-handler JS-string escape, `SnapSafe.safeUrl`, `html` tag, `sanitizeRich`.
- **Global guard**: every `innerHTML` / `outerHTML` / `insertAdjacentHTML` write is sanitised: script/iframe-js/object/embed/base/meta removed, `on*` attributes removed except user-click ones (`onclick`, `onchange`, `oninput`, `onsubmit`, key/focus/blur) and the simple `<img onerror="this.style.display='none'">` fallback, `javascript:`/`data:text/html`/`srcdoc` removed. Normal UI (buttons, inputs, tables, SVG icons) keeps working.
- `scripts/xss-autofix.js` (acorn AST): in HTML-building template literals, free-text fields (name, title, label, subject, chapter, message, address, ...) are wrapped with `__sx(...)`, and values inside inline handlers (`onclick="f('${x.id}')"`) with `__sj(...)`. Idempotent; run again after adding new code.
- Question/option/explanation text is intentionally NOT escaped (it may hold b/i/sub/sup/math); it is protected by the guard. Use `SnapSafe.sanitizeRich()` for new code that renders such text.
- CSP `<meta>` + referrer policy added to index.html, owner-app.html, question-generator.html.

## Not fixed / residual risk
- HTML built with string concatenation (`"<b>"+x+"</b>"`) was not auto-escaped (only the guard protects it). Convert gradually to `SnapSafe.html` or DOM APIs (`textContent`).
- Handlers that need a click (`onclick`) cannot be told apart from legit ones once injected; the escaping at the source is what prevents them. Fields not in the free-text list are not escaped yet.
- CSP still has `unsafe-inline` (inline scripts + inline handlers exist) and index.html also `unsafe-eval` (Solids Lab uses Babel + new Function). Next step: move inline scripts to files, then remove `unsafe-inline`.
- `connect-src` allows any `https:`; tighten to the known hosts after a week of normal use.
- GitHub Pages cannot send real headers (`frame-ancestors`, HSTS...). Optional: put free Cloudflare in front of the site.

## Worker review (push-worker/worker.js)
- `/owner/*`, `/alerts*`: owner Firebase token + OWNER_EMAILS check. `/broadcast`: secret compared constant-time. `/bank` PUT, `/files/*` writes, `/live/*`: admin token (institute checked). No redirects (`Location`) anywhere -> no open redirect. Responses are JSON (no HTML) -> no HTML injection.
- `/alert` is public by design (error reports). Add rate-limit in Phase 10. Default owner emails are hard-coded as fallback (Phase 10).
